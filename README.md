# TapAroo
This project was created to help ease the creation of a tap display and to help keep track of beer 
inventory for the building administrators. The user can simply select the two beers which
will be on tap, or are currently on tap, and what is currently in the cooler then click update
tap and the beers selected will be displayed/updated on the display page. The purpose of this
project was to simplify  the tap display without having to hassle with writing on a chalk board and 
instead having a nice, simple display on a tablet. 
The technologies we used for this project included AngularJS, Express, Bootstrap, Socket.IO, Slack
Integration, Chrome Extensions, HTML, CSS, Trello, Github, Heroku, Firebase, Knex.js, Ipad IOS. We also
used an Agile workflow through out the project. Using user-stories to focus on the goals we wanted 
to achieve for the day.
